# CADDY NETWORK CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# Copy this file to caddy.env
# List all Docker networks that Caddy should connect to
#
# Format: Space-separated list of network names
# Use the EXACT network names as they appear in `docker network ls`
#
# Example:
#   NETWORKS="lcdvn-network projectb-network my-app-net"
#
# The bootstrap.sh script will connect Caddy to each network listed here,
# allowing it to reverse proxy to containers on those networks.

NETWORKS="lcdvn-network"

# =============================================================================
# CADDY CONFIG FILES
# =============================================================================
# List of Caddyfile paths to copy to caddy-projects/ during bootstrap
# These files will be copied and renamed with .caddy extension
#
# Format: Space-separated list of absolute file paths
# Each file will be copied to caddy-projects/<basename>.caddy
#
# Example:
#   CADDY_FILES="/root/lich-cup-dien-infras/Caddyfile.static /root/projectb/Caddyfile.static"

CADDY_FILES=""

# 1. Ensure the project's docker-compose.yml defines network with explicit name:
#
#    networks:
#      myproject-network:
#        name: myproject-network    # <-- important!
#        driver: bridge
#
# 2. Add the network name to NETWORKS above
# 3. Add the project's Caddyfile path to CADDY_FILES above
# 4. Run: ./bootstrap.sh
# 5. Caddy will be reloaded automatically
